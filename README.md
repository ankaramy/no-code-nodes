# No-Code Nodes

A collection of explorations from the AEC Tech Hackathon 2025 Barcelona, focusing on building and surface data processing using n8n workflows and custom nodes.

> **Note**: This is a work in progress and represents our explorations during the hackathon. The code and workflows are experimental and may require adjustments to work in your environment.

## Project Overview

This repository contains our experiments with n8n workflows and custom nodes for processing building and surface data. The project aims to demonstrate how no-code/low-code tools can be used to process and analyze AEC data.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into four main directories:

### 1. n8n-custom-nodes/

Custom JavaScript functions that operate on data within n8n workflows:

- `prepare_building_sentences.js` - Prepares building data for natural language processing
- `aggregate_building_stats.js` - Aggregates building statistics and metrics
- `aggregate_surface_stats.js` - Aggregates surface statistics and measurements
- `get_building_data.js` - Retrieves building data from various sources
- `get_surface_data.js` - Retrieves surface data and measurements

### 2. n8n-server-functions/

Server-side functions for n8n, including:

- `classify/` - Contains classification functions for building and surface data
- GCP Functions for data processing and analysis

### 3. n8n-graph/

Contains n8n workflow graphs and configurations that demonstrate how to:

- Process building data
- Analyze surface measurements
- Generate reports and visualizations
- Integrate with various data sources

### 4. n8n-scripts/

Contains a set of auxillary scripts that we used ot explore integrating various apis in this project. For example, we created a simmple wrapper of the citywerf api to get the 3d geometry data in the grasshopper environment. There was also some exploration in a python notebook attempting to connect to the infrared api. We have not managed to get the API to successfully connect, however we imagine its an implementation issue rather than anything else. If you know whats wrong heko us please :).

- `city-weft-to-infrared`
- `NodeJsonGeometryBuilder`

## Prerequisites

- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) either docker deployed or running just on the web
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/no-code-nodes.git
cd no-code-nodes
```

## Usage

1. Create a workspace in n8n
2. Import the workflow graphs from the `n8n-graph/` directory as needed
3. The custom nodes will be available in the n8n workflow editor
4. Run the workflow (might break, we tinkered a lot and by the time you read this, we likely tore down the server functions, but atleast you have the code to replicate it your self)

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
